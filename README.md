# Mogwump's Alternate Recipes

If you an avid tech mod enthusiast, you have probably come across the terms "vertical scalability" and "horizontal scalability". Put simply, vertical scaling is making your one process go faster, whereas horizontal scaling is just building more.

If you have multiple large tech mods, they sort of act like different towers standing next to each other with a few bridges between them. You can get materials from one process to completely skip another process from a different mod, but you mostly progress in each mod individually.

This mod aims to tweak a few recipes to force you to delve deeper into certain mods, and make you automate things you wouldn't normally automate.

This will make progression more difficult and force you to utilise multiple mods' progression.

The intent is to make progression feel a bit more coherent in smaller, private packs where you don''t want to put in the effort of going through every single item and adding custom recipes. This will also provide a few more automation/logistical challenges for a lot of mods due to increased complexity and resource demand.
